I'm a **self-taught developer** with no degree — just real skills, curiosity, and nonstop debugging energy.

I love:
- Building things from scratch  
- Breaking stuff to understand how things work  
- Fixing and improving what I break  
- Sharing my learning journey  

**My goal:**  
Create useful things, solve real problems, and keep learning every day.
