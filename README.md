<p align="center">
 Welcome to <b>Abdur IT</b> — my space where I build, break, fix, and share everything I learn.
</p>


## 👨‍💻 About Me  
I'm a **self-taught developer** with no degree — just real skills, curiosity, and nonstop debugging energy.

I love:
- Building things from scratch  
- Breaking stuff to understand how things work  
- Fixing and improving what I break  
- Sharing my learning journey  

**My goal:**  
Create useful things, solve real problems, and keep learning every day.
